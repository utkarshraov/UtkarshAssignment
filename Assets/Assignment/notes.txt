Assignment Notes

Assignment: 7 Multiplayer
Student: Utkarsh Rao Viswavasu

For this assignment, I closely followed this tutorial on Photon I found on youtube (Which I think several other students also followed.)

In terms of meeting the assignment requirements, my submission contains
-the ability to make and join rooms (multiple rooms supported)
-players can enter their names prior to entering a lobby
-the game only starts once all players are connected (The server/host loads first then gets everyone else to load, waits for them to complete, and then begins the game)
-Players can only control their units
-The units spawn currently all in the same spot which is causing some issues but their positions and rotations are synced across all connected players
-All spells aside from Stealth and Spell Shield work pretty well, although the vfx are a little janky
-the game spawns correctly for all players including the obstacle and rounds. 

SOmething that made this assignment really hard to test was the fact that both playing the game in editor and in the build
the game would completely stop ticking if i clicked away from the corresponding window. Because it would actually stop ticking,
the game would fall out of sync on the multiplayer front. I wasn't sure how to solve this problem, I asked on the discussion board but didn't get 
a response in time(I leave for India on thursday morning and will be flying until the due date)

I did the best I could considering that, but it's fairly janky because of it. 

For the purposes of this assignment, I took out single player functionality, so this only works in multiplayer mode
and you must start from the scene MultiPlayerLobby to get the game to work alone. 
I made a separate branch called Multiplayer so as to preserve the original single palyer version.
